#Alerts

alert.credential_dumping.name=Credential Dumping
alert.credential_dumping.desc=Credential dumping is the process of obtaining account login and password information, normally in the form of a hash or a clear text password, from the operating system and software. Credentials can then be used to perform Lateral Movement and access restricted information.
alert.credential_dumping.related=Related Threats: Common credential dumpers such as Mimikatz access the LSA Subsystem Service (LSASS) process by opening the process, locating the LSA secrets key, and decrypting the sections in memory where credential details are stored. Credential dumpers may also use methods for reflective Process Injection to reduce potential indicators of malicious activity.

alert.discovery_reconnaissance.name=Discovery & Reconnaissance
alert.discovery_reconnaissance.desc=Discovery consists of techniques that allow the adversary to gain knowledge about the system and internal network. When Attackers gain access to a new system, they must orient themselves to what they now have control of and what benefits operating from that system give to their current objective or overall goals during the intrusion. The operating system provides many native tools that aid in this post-compromise information-gathering phase.
alert.discovery_reconnaissance.related=Related Threats: Example commands that can acquire this information are net user, net group , and net localgroup using the Net utility or through use of dsquery. If Attackers attempt to identify the primary user, currently logged in user, or set of users that commonly uses a system, System Owner/User Discovery may apply.

alert.powershell_scripting.name=PowerShell & Scripting
alert.powershell_scripting.desc=PowerShell is a powerful interactive command-line interface and scripting environment included in the Windows operating system. Attackers can use PowerShell to perform a number of actions, including discovery of information and execution of code. Examples include the Start-Process cmdlet which can be used to run an executable and the Invoke-Command cmdlet which runs a command locally or on a remote computer.
alert.powershell_scripting.related=Related Threats: PowerShell is a powerful interactive command-line interface and scripting environment included in the Windows operating system. Attackers can use PowerShell to perform a number of actions, including discovery of information and execution of code. Examples include the Start-Process cmdlet which can be used to run an executable and the Invoke-Command cmdlet which runs a command locally or on a remote computer. PowerShell may also be used to download and run executables from the Internet, which can be executed from disk or in memory without touching disk. Administrator permissions are required to use PowerShell to connect to remote systems.

alert.registry_run_keys.name=Registry Run Keys & Start Folder
alert.registry_run_keys.desc=Adding an entry to the "run keys" in the Registry or startup folder will cause the program referenced to be executed when a user logs in. The program will be executed under the context of the user and will have the account's associated permissions level. Attackers can use these configuration locations to execute malware, such as remote access tools, to maintain persistence through system reboots. Attackers may also use Masquerading to make the Registry entries look as if they are associated with legitimate programs.
alert.registry_run_keys.related=Related Threats: Adding an entry to the "run keys" in the Registry or startup folder will cause the program referenced to be executed when a user logs in. These programs will be executed under the context of the user and will have the account's associated permissions level.

alert.process_injection.name=Process Injection
alert.process_injection.desc=Process injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process. Running code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via process injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.
alert.process_injection.related=Related Threats: Dynamic-link library (DLL) injection involves writing the path to a malicious DLL inside a process then invoking execution by creating a remote thread. Portable executable injection involves writing malicious code directly into the process (without a file on disk) then invoking execution with either additional code or by creating a remote thread. Thread execution hijacking involves injecting malicious code or the path to a DLL into a thread of a process. Similar to Process Hollowing, the thread must first be suspended. Asynchronous Procedure Call (APC) injection involves attaching malicious code to the APC Queue of a process's thread. Thread Local Storage (TLS) callback injection involves manipulating pointers inside a portable executable (PE) to redirect a process to malicious code before reaching the code's legitimate entry point.

alert.mass_changes_to_critical_enterprise_groups.name=Mass Changes to Critical Enterprise Groups
alert.mass_changes_to_critical_enterprise_groups.desc=An abnormal number of changes have been made to critical enterprise groups. These groups often manage and control high-value IT assets. If these assets were compromised, attackers could escalate privileges and exploit them to establish persistent control over the domain. Investigate which elements have been changed, and decide if the changes were legitimate or possibly the result of risky or malicious behavior. This activity is usually associated with the <b>Multiple Member Additions to Enterprise Critical Groups</b> indicator.
alert.mass_changes_to_critical_enterprise_groups.related=Related Threats: Account Manipulation - Account manipulation may aid attackers in maintaining access to credentials and certain permission levels within an environment. Manipulation could consist of modifying permissions, adding or changing permission groups, modifying account settings, or modifying how authentication is performed.

alert.mass_changes_to_groups.name=Mass Changes to Groups
alert.mass_changes_to_groups.desc=An abnormal number of changes have been made to groups. Investigate which elements have been changed, and decide if the changes were legitimate or possibly the result of risky or malicious behavior. This activity is usually associated with the <b>Multiple Group Membership Changes</b> indicator.
alert.mass_changes_to_groups.related=Related Threats: Account Manipulation - Account manipulation may aid attackers in maintaining access to credentials and certain permission levels within an environment. Manipulation could consist of modifying permissions, adding or changing permission groups, modifying account settings, or modifying how authentication is performed.

alert.elevated_privileges_granted.name=Elevated Privileges Granted (Rule)
alert.elevated_privileges_granted.desc=Attackers often use regular user accounts, granting them elevated privileges, to exploit the network. Investigate the user that received the elevated privileges, and decide if these changes were legitimate or possibly the result of risky or malicious behavior.
alert.elevated_privileges_granted.related=Related Threats: Account Manipulation - Account manipulation may aid attackers in maintaining access to credentials and certain permission levels within an environment. Manipulation could consist of modifying permissions, adding or changing permission groups, modifying account settings, or modifying how authentication is performed.

alert.brute_force_authentication.name=Brute Force Authentication
alert.brute_force_authentication.desc=In traditional password cracking attempts, the attacker will try to obtain a password through guesswork or by employing other low-tech methods to gain initial access. The attacker risks getting caught or being locked out by explicitly attempting to authenticate; but with some prior knowledge of the victim's password history, may be able to successfully authenticate. Look for additional abnormal indications that the account owner is not the one attempting to access this account. This activity is usually associated with the Multiple Failed Authentications indicator. 
alert.brute_force_authentication.related=Related Threats: Brute Force - Attackers may attempt to brute force logons without knowledge of passwords or hashes during an operation either with zero knowledge or by attempting a list of known or possible passwords. A related technique uses one password, or a small list of passwords, that matches the complexity policy of the domain and may be a commonly used password. Logons are attempted with that password and many different accounts on a network to avoid account lockouts that would normally occur when brute forcing a single account with many passwords.

alert.multiple_logons_by_user.name=Multiple Logons by User
alert.multiple_logons_by_user.desc=All authentication activity, malicious or not, appears as normal logons. Therefore, administrators should monitor unexpected "authorized" activity. The key is that attackers use these stolen credentials for unauthorized access, which may provide an opportunity for detection. When an account is being used for unusual activities, e.g. authenticating an unusual amount of times, then the account may have been compromised. This activity can be associated with the Multiple Successful Authentications indicator. 
alert.multiple_logons_by_user.related=Related Threats: Valid Account Abuse -  Attackers may steal the credentials of a specific user or service account using Credential Access techniques. Compromised credentials may be used to bypass access controls within the network and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems. These credentials may also grant an attacker increased privilege to specific systems or access to restricted areas of the network.

alert.user_login_to_abnormal_remote_host.name=User Logon to Abnormal Remote Host
alert.user_login_to_abnormal_remote_host.desc=Attackers will often need to reacquire credentials and perform other sensitive activities, like using remote access. Tracing the access chain backwards may lead to the discovery of other hosts involved in possibly risky activity. If an attacker's presence is limited to a single compromised host or to many compromised hosts, that activity can be associated with the Abnormal Remote Host and Abnormal Host indicators. 
alert.user_login_to_abnormal_remote_host.related=Related Threats: Remote Desktop Protocol - Attackers may connect to a remote system over RDP/RDS to expand access if the service is enabled and allows access to accounts with known credentials. Attackers will likely use Credential Access techniques to acquire credentials to use with RDP.


alert.user_login_to_abnormal_host.name=User Logon to Abnormal Host
alert.user_login_to_abnormal_host.desc=Attackers will often need to reacquire credentials and perform other sensitive functions, like using remote access. Tracing the access chain backwards may lead to the discovery of other hosts involved in possibly risky activity. If an attacker's presence is limited to a single compromised host or to many compromised hosts, that activity can be associated with the Abnormal Remote Host and Abnormal Host indicators. 
alert.user_login_to_abnormal_host.related=Related Threats: Valid Account Abuse - Attackers may steal the credentials of a specific user or service account using Credential Access techniques. Compromised credentials may be used to bypass access controls within the network and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems. These credentials may also grant an attacker increased privilege to specific systems or access to restricted areas of the network.


alert.abnormal_site_access.name=Abnormal Site Access
alert.abnormal_site_access.desc=Domain controllers store credential password hashes for all accounts on the domain, so they are high-value targets for attackers. Domain controllers that aren't stringently updated and secured are susceptible to attack and compromise, which could leave the domain and forest vulnerable. User privileges on multiple domains could indicate that a parent domain has been compromised. Determine if user access to/from multiple domains is legitimate or is an indication of a potential compromise. This activity is usually associated with the Abnormal Site and Logon Attempts from Multiple Sites indicators
alert.abnormal_site_access.related=Related Threats: Valid Account Abuse -  Attackers may steal the credentials of a specific user or service account using Credential Access techniques. Compromised credentials may be used to bypass access controls within the network and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems. These credentials may also grant an attacker increased privilege to specific systems or access to restricted areas of the network.


alert.data_exfiltration.name=Data Exfiltration
alert.data_exfiltration.desc=Data exfiltration is the unauthorized copying, transfer, or retrieval of data from a computer or server. Data exfiltration is a malicious activity performed through various techniques, typically by cybercriminals over the Internet or other network. This activity can be associated with the <b>Excessive Number of File Delete Events, Excessive Number of Files Moved.<b> 
alert.data_exfiltration.related = Related Threats: Scheduled Transfers - Data exfiltration may be performed only at certain times of day or at certain intervals. This could be done to blend traffic patterns with normal activity or availability.

alert.mass_file_rename.name=Mass File Rename
alert.mass_file_rename.desc=Mass file renaming, triggered by a specific system or local service account could indicate the system may have been infected by Ransomware. Investigating the source user and related file types and folder names can quickly resolve if in fact ransomware has spread across the file system. This activity can be associated with the Multiple File Rename Events indicator. 
alert.mass_file_rename.related = Related Threats: Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts desktop and system files, making them inaccessible. Some ransomware, e.g. "Locky", encrypt and rename files as part of their initial execution. Use this indication of mass-file-renaming to determine if your file system has been infected with Ransomware.

alert.snooping_user.name=Snooping User
alert.snooping_user.desc=Snooping is unauthorized access to another person's or company's data. Snooping can be as simple as the casual observance of an e-mail on another's computer, or watching what someone else is typing. More sophisticated snooping uses software programs to remotely monitor activity on a computer or network device. This activity can be associated with the Multiple File Access Events, Multiple Failed File Access Events, Multiple File Open Events, and Multiple Folder Open Events indicators. 
alert.snooping_user.related=Related Threats: File System Discovery - Attackers may enumerate files and directories or may search in specific locations of a host or network share for certain information within a file system.

alert.user_logins_to_multiple_ad_sites.name=User Logons to Multiple Domains
alert.user_logins_to_multiple_ad_sites.desc=Domain controllers store credential password hashes for all accounts on the domain, so they are high-value targets for attackers. Domain controllers that aren't stringently updated and secured are susceptible to attack and compromise, which could leave the domain and forest vulnerable. User privileges on multiple domains could indicate that a parent domain has been compromised. Determine if user access to/from multiple domains is legitimate or is an indication of a potential compromise. This activity is usually associated with the Logged into Multiple Domains indicator. 
alert.user_logins_to_multiple_ad_sites.related=Related Threats: Valid Account Abuse -  Attackers may steal the credentials of a specific user or service account using Credential Access techniques. Compromised credentials may be used to bypass access controls within the network and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems. These credentials may also grant an attacker increased privilege to specific systems or access to restricted areas of the network.


alert.user_logged_into_multiple_hosts.name=User Logons to Multiple Hosts
alert.user_logged_into_multiple_hosts.desc=Attackers typically need to reacquire credentials periodically. This is because their keychain of stolen credentials will naturally degrade over time, due to password changes and resets. Therefore, attackers frequently maintain a foothold in the compromised organization by installing backdoors and maintaining credentials from many hosts in the environment. This activity can be associated with the Logged onto Multiple Hosts indicator. Valid Account Abuse -  Attackers may steal the credentials of a specific user or service account using Credential Access techniques. Compromised credentials may be used to bypass access controls within the network and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems. These credentials may also grant an attacker increased privilege to specific systems or access to restricted areas of the network.
alert.user_logged_into_multiple_hosts.related=Related Threats: Valid Account Abuse -  Attackers may steal the credentials of a specific user or service account using Credential Access techniques. Compromised credentials may be used to bypass access controls within the network and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems. These credentials may also grant an attacker increased privilege to specific systems or access to restricted areas of the network.

alert.admin_password_change.name=Admin Password Change (Rule)
alert.admin_password_change.desc=Shared long-term secrets, e.g. privileged account passwords, are frequently used to access anything from print servers to domain controllers. To contain attackers, that seek to leverage these accounts, pay close attention to password changes by admins, and ensure they have been made by trusted parties and have no additional abnormal behavior associated with them. This activity can be associated with the <b>Admin Password Change</b> indicator. 
alert.admin_password_change.related=Related Threats: Account Manipulation - Account manipulation may aid attackers in maintaining access to credentials and certain permission levels within an environment. Manipulation could consist of modifying permissions, adding or changing permission groups, modifying account settings, or modifying how authentication is performed.

alert.mass_permission_changes.name=Mass Permission Changes
alert.mass_permission_changes.desc=Some credential theft techniques, e.g. Pass-the-Hash, use an iterative, two-stage process. First, an attacker obtains elevated read/write permission to privileged areas of volatile memory and file systems, which are typically accessible only to system-level processes on at least one computer. Second, the attacker attempts to increase access to other hosts on the network. Investigate if abnormal permission changes have taken place on the file systems to ensure that they were not compromised by an attacker. This activity can be associated with the Multiple File Access Permission Changes, Multiple Failed File Access Permission Changes, and Abnormal File Access Permission Change indicators. 
alert.mass_permission_changes.related=Related Threats: File System Permissions Weakness -  Attackers may replace a legitimate service executable with their own executable to gain persistence and/or privilege escalation to the account context the service is set to execute under (local/domain account, SYSTEM, LocalService, or NetworkService).

alert.abnormal_ad_changes.name=Abnormal AD Changes
alert.abnormal_ad_changes.desc=If an attacker gains highly privileged access to an Active Directory domain or domain controller, that access can be leveraged to access, control, or even destroy the entire forest. If a single domain controller is compromised and an attacker modifies the AD database, those modifications replicate to every other domain controller in the domain, and depending on the partition in which the modifications are made, the forest as well. Investigate abnormal changes conducted by admins and non-admins in AD to determine if they represent a possible true compromise to the domain. This activity can be associated with the Abnormal Active Directory Change, Multiple Account Management Changes, Multiple User Account Management Changes, and Multiple Failed Account Management Changes indicators. 
alert.abnormal_ad_changes.related=Related Threats: Malicious Account Creation - Attackers with a sufficient access may create a domain account that can be used for persistence that does not require persistent remote access tools to be deployed on the system; Account Manipulation - Account manipulation may aid attackers in maintaining access to credentials and certain permission levels within an environment. Manipulation could consist of modifying permissions, adding or changing permission groups, modifying account settings, or modifying how authentication is performed; Account Discovery - Attackers may attempt to get a listing of local system or domain accounts.; Permission Groups Discovery - Attackers may attempt to find local system or domain-level groups and permissions settings.

alert.sensitive_user_status_changes.name=Sensitive User Status Changes (Rule)
alert.sensitive_user_status_changes.desc=A domain or enterprise administrator account has the default ability to exercise control over all resources in a domain, regardless of whether it operates with malicious or benign intent. This control includes the ability to create and change accounts; read, write, or delete data; install or alter applications; and erase operating systems. Some of these activities trigger organically as part of the account's natural life cycle. Investigate these security sensitive user account changes, and determine if it has been compromised.
alert.sensitive_user_status_changes.related=Related Threats: Account Manipulation - Account manipulation may aid attackers in maintaining access to credentials and certain permission levels within an environment. Manipulation could consist of modifying permissions, adding or changing permission groups, modifying account settings, or modifying how authentication is performed.

alert.abnormal_file_access.name=Abnormal File Access
alert.abnormal_file_access.desc=Monitor for abnormal file access to prevent improper access to confidential files and theft of sensitive data. By selectively monitoring file views, modifications and deletions, you can detect possibly unauthorized changes to sensitive files, whether caused by an attack or a change management error. This activity can be associated with the <b>Abnormal File Access Indicator</b>. 
alert.abnormal_file_access.related=Related Threats: Remote File Access - Files may be moved or copied from one system to another to stage attacker tools or other files over the course of an operation. Attackers may also move files laterally between internal victim systems to support Lateral Movement with remote execution using authenticated connections with Windows Admin Shares or Remote Desktop Protocol.

alert.non_standard_hours.name=Non-Standard Hours
alert.non_standard_hours.desc=All authentication activity, malicious or not, appears as normal logons. Therefore, administrators should monitor unexpected authorized activity. The key is that attackers use these stolen credentials for unauthorized access, which may provide an opportunity for detection. When an account is being used for unusual activities, e.g. authenticating an unusual number of times, then the account may have been compromised. Use the indication of an abnormal activity time to determine if the account has been taken over by an external actor. This activity can be associated with the Abnormal File Access Time, Abnormal Active Directory Change Time, and Abnormal Logon Time indicators. 
alert.non_standard_hours.related=Related Threats: Logon Scripts - Windows allows logon scripts to be run whenever a specific user or group of users log into a system. If Attackers can access these scripts, they may insert additional code into the logon script to execute their tools when a user logs in. This code can allow them to maintain persistence on a single system, if it is a local script, or to move laterally within a network, if the script is stored on a central server and pushed to many systems. Depending on the access configuration of the logon scripts, either local credentials or an administrator account may be necessary.
