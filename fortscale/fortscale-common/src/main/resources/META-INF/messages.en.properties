#Alerts
fortscale.message.alert.vpn_geo_hopping.name=Anomalous Geolocation Sequence
fortscale.message.alert.vpn_geo_hopping.desc=An account has logged in from multiple geographic locations in an impossibly short timeframe. Review this alert and determine if the appearance in two or more countries in a short timeframe is plausible.
