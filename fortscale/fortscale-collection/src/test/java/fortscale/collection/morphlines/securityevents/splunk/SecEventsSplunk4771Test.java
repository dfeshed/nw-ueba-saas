It is generated on the computer that was accessed.  The subject fields indicate the account on the local system which requested the logon. This is most commonly a service such as the Server service, or a local process such as Winlogon.exe or Services.exe.  The logon type field indicates the kind of logon that occurred. The most common types are 2 (interactive) and 3 (network). The New Logon fields indicate the account for whom the new logon was created, i.e. the account that was logged on. The network fields indicate where a remote logon request originated. Workstation name is not always available and may be left blank in some cases. The authentication information fields provide detailed information about this specific logon request. 	- Logon GUID is a unique identifier that can be used to correlate this event with a KDC event. 	- Transited services indicate which intermediate services have participated in this logon request. 	- Package name indicates which sub-protocol was used among the NTLM protocols. 	- Key length indicates the length of the generated session key.
