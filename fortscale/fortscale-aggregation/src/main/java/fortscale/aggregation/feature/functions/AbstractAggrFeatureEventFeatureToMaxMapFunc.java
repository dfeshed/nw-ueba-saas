/**
 * Aggregate one or more buckets containing a feature containing a mapping from features group to max value.
 * Such a mapping (of type Map<List<String>, Integer>) is created by AggrFeatureFeatureToMaxMapFunc.
 * If configured to aggregate more than one bucket, first the buckets' mappings will be aggregated into one mapping
 * such that every features group will be mapped to the maximal value among all the values of the instances of this
 * features group among the buckets' mappings.
 *
 * The final step should be performed by an extending class - which is to take
 * the aggregated mapping and compute some value out of it (e.g. - sum).
 *
 * Parameters this class gets from the ASL:
 * 1. pick: the name of the feature stored in the buckets which its value should be picked and used by this class.
