# InvestigateHosts

InvestigateHosts is a routable [ember-engine](https://github.com/ember-engines/ember-engines) that is [mounted](https://github.com/ember-engines/ember-engines.com/blob/66759f39726617b3a17f1f0088ccd78ac73380ce/markdown/guide/mounting-engines.md#routable-engines) inside the sa application at `/investigate/hosts`.

You can treat the InvestigateHosts engine as its own application for development purposes. If you are developing InvestigateHosts, all work can take place in the engine without ever needing to run the sa application.
