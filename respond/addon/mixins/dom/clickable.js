   * Specifies how this component's items should respond to clicks.
   *
   * If `isInSelectMode` is `false`, items will follow standard selection behavior when clicked.  Specifically, a clicked
   * item will become the one & only selected item in the list.  The previous selection (if any) is cleared.  Users can
   * select multiple items by using Shift+Click or Ctrl+Click.
   *
   * If `isInSelectMode` is `true`, items will follow checkbox-like selection behavior when clicked. Specifically, a
   * clicked item will become selected and remain selected even after other items are subsequently clicked.  The selected
   * item can be un-selected by clicking on it again.  This is essentially the same behavior that happens with Ctrl+Clicks
   * when `isInSelectMode` is `false`. The difference is that when `isInSelectMode` is `true`, the user doesn't need to
   * press the Ctrl key; simple clicking will suffice.
   *
   * The purpose of this feature is to support list UIs which expose an "Edit" or "Select" mode to the user. It enables
   * the user to select multiple list items with simple clicking and then typically choose an action to apply on
   * all the selected items.

   * "shiftClickAction": function to be invoked if SHIFT key was detected;
   * "ctrlClickAction": function to be invoked if either CTRL or ALT or CMD key was detected and SHIFT key was not detected;
   * "clickAction": function to be invoked if either:
   * (a) CTRL + SHIFT keys were not detected, or
   * (b) SHIFT or CLICK key was detected but the corresponding action for them is not defined.

   * The invoked action will receive the data item that was targeted (or null, if none), plus a hash indicating which modifier
   * keys were pressed during the event (e.g., {shiftKey: true, ctrlKey: true}.
   *
   * Note: Typically in Ember, we invoke actions on click by simply using the `{{action}}` helper in a template. However,
   * the helper doesn't pass in any modifier-key state into the action.  Therefore, in order to support modifier key
   * detection here, we must implement this logic in the component's `click()` handler.
