/**
 * @class Incident Enrichments component
 * Displays a single entry from a set of enrichment data.
 *
 * This component encapsulates the intelligence for parsing an enrichment into a user-friendly presentation.
 * Generally, it's pretty straightforward: the enrichment score is tested against some minimum threshold, and
 * if it passes the threshold, it is mapped to i18n text and rendered in DOM.  There are some minor exceptions,
 * however, and they are handled by this component as well.
 *
 * Note that enrichment data structures can & will evolve over releases, so this component will likely
 * evolve & iterate over time.

  /**
   * The enrichment hash from which data is to be looked up. Possibly null or empty.
   *
   * The enrichment data structure will evolve over time. As of this writing, the overall structure is a hierarchy
   * of nested POJOs.  The general hierarchy is, in backend terminology, "activity" -> "enrichments".  There are
   * several supported "activities", which can each be enabled/disabled/configured separately.  Each activity
   * will have its own set of "enrichments", which are basically key-value pairs.
   *
   * Some/most of these key-value pairs are not intended for display; they are more like private variables used
   * to compute some quantity for user display (usually some sort of "score").
   *
   * Bottom line: the backend spec is kinda quirky, not well-documented & subject to change. For now, whenever the
   * backend changes this structure, we'll need to update this component.
   *
   * @example
   * ```
   * {
   *   ctxhub: {
   *     'domain_is_whitelisted': false
   *   },
   *   domain: {
   *     'ua_ratio_score': 100,
   *     'ua_score': 100,
   *     'referer_score': 100,
   *     ..
   *   },
   *   whois: {
   *     'age_score': 100,
   *     'validity_score': 100,
   *     ..
   *   },
   *   smooth: {
   *     'smooth_beaconing_score': 100
   *   }
   * }
   * ```
