/**
 * @file Drag Behavior utility
 * A configurable helper for detecting & handling user-initiated drag events in DOM.
 *
 * How to use:
 *
 * 1. Create an instance of this behavior utility. Pass in a hash of whatever `callbacks` you want, like so:
 * ```js
 * import DragBehavior from 'respond/utils/behaviors/drag';
 *
 * let myBehavior = DragBehavior.create({
 *  callbacks: {
 *    // These are functions that do whatever you want. Maybe they manipulate DOM, set object properties,
 *    // or fire redux actions. Doesn't matter, it's totally up to you & your use case.
 *    dragstart: ..,
 *    dragmove: ..,
 *    dragend: ..
 *  }
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * 2. Now have your Component call your behavior's `mouseDidDown()` whenever it hears a mousedown. That's it!
 *
 * ```js
 * // From a Component, you can just do this:
 * export default Component.extend({
 *  mouseDown(e) {
 *    myBehavior.mouseDidDown(e);
 *  }
 * });
 *
 * // Alternatively, if you want to use on an arbitrary DOM node, invoke with jQuery:
 * $('.my-drag-handle').on('mousedown', function(e) {
 *   myBehavior.mouseDidDown(e);
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Note: We may eventually replace this utility with some 3rd party addon from the Ember community.
