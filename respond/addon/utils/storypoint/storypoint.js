/**
 * @class StoryPoint
 * A wrapper object for indicators (alerts) that are to be displayed in a "storyline"-like UI.
 *
 * Such indicators will need a list of events, which must be fetched from a separate API and then stored in this
 * object with the indicator definition.
 *
 * The storyline UI will actually be implemented as an `rsa-group-table`, therefore this data structure is designed
 * to mimic a `Group` object that can be consumed by a group table (@see respond/mixins/group-table/has-grouped-rows).
 * Specifically, each group is supposed to have an `items` array, which is expanded/collapsed based on the group's
 * `isOpen` boolean.  In this storyline UI, the user can toggle each group to view either the events or the enrichments.
 * Therefore each group has a boolean `showEnrichmentsAsItem`; if falsey, the events are used for the items;
 * otherwise, the enrichments are used for the items.

   * Computes an array of enrichments (possibly empty) from the current list of events.
   *
   * Enrichments are actually event properties. Each event may have an (optional) `enrichment` POJO, which is a
   * deeply nested hash of various enrichment key-value pairs, grouped by "activity" (as ESA likes to call them).
   * There are several supported "activities", which can each be enabled/disabled/configured separately.  Each activity
   * will have its own set of enrichment data, which is basically key-value pairs.
   * Here we aggregate the enrichments into a flat array that can be more easily consumed by the UI.
   *
   * Some/most of these key-value pairs are not intended for display; they are more like private variables used
   * to compute some quantity for user display (usually some sort of "score").  So our computed result here will
   * not include all the enrichments; just the ones meant for display.
   *
   * @see ASOC-32758 comments for a list of the latest enrichment POJO property names
   * @example
   * ```
   * enrichment: {
