"""
Every time the system is restarted, especially after an upgrade, the Presidio Manager service could be loaded with
changed or new configurations. These configurations need to be updated outside the Configuration Server as well.
Therefore, this Python script:
1. Waits for the Presidio Manager service to finish loading.
2. Sends an empty Patch request to redistribute all configurations.
   Specifically, the request updates the 'workflows-default.json' file.
