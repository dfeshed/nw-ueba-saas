# Configure Engine

The Configure engine will provide the set of featues related to configuring portions of the NetWitness Suite. Specifically, the features found under Configure will provide advanced settings specific to the behavior of the product, but independent from NetWitness systems administrative functionality (which is found under the Admin navigation).
